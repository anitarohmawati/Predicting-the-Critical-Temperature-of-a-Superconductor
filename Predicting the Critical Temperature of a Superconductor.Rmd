\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}
Superconductivity is a phenomenon of exactly zero electrical resistance and expulsion of magnetic flux fields occurring in certain materials, called superconductors, when cooled below a characteristic critical temperature. One of the applications is in the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) systems which is widely performed by health case professionals for detailed internal body imaging.

Predicting the critical temperature (Tc) of a superconductor is still an open problem in the scientific community. In the past, simple empirical rules based on experiments have guided researchers in synthesizing superconducting materials for many years. Nowadays, features (or predictors) based on the superconductor’s elemental properties can be generated and used to predict Tc.

In this task, we are going to analyze superconductor data from the Superconducting Material Database maintained by Japan’s National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS). The aim is to build statistical models that can predict Tc based on the material’s chemical properties.

\subsection{Data Preparation}
The dataset for this assessment is from the Superconducting Material Database maintenained by Japan's National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS) and processed by @hamidieh2018data. There are two datasets namely train.csv and unique_m.csv. The first dataset contains a large list of cuperconductors, their critical temperatures and other variables, meanwhile the later contains the chemical formula of each corresponding material.

\subsubsection{Superconducting Material Dataset}
In this subsection, we will load the **train.csv** dataset and print the dimension of the dataset.
```{r}
# Loading the dataset
data <- read.csv(file="superconduct//train.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
head(data)
```

```{r}
cat("Total Rows: ",dim(data)[1])
cat("\nTotal Columns: ",dim(data)[2])
```
The **train.csv** has 21263 rows and 82 columns.


\subsubsection{Element Dataset}
In this subsection, we will load the **unique_m.csv** dataset and print the dimension of the dataset.
```{r}
# Loading the dataset
chemical <- read.csv(file="superconduct//unique_m.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
head(chemical)
```
```{r}
cat("Total Rows: ",dim(chemical)[1])
cat("\nTotal Columns: ",dim(chemical)[2])
```
The **unique_m.csv** has 21263 rows and 88 columns

\subsection{Data Description}
\subsubsection{Superconducting Material Dataset}
In this subsection, we will describe the meaning of each column and its datatype of the superconducting material dataset.
```{r}
# Description of the Superconducting Material Dataset
str(data)
```


From the above information,  it can be seen that all variables are numeric variables and each record contains number_of_element, eight main properties (Atomic Mass, First Ionization Energy, Atomic Radius, Density, Electron Affinity, Fusion Heat, Thermal Conductivity, Valence) and the critical_temp. For each main property, ten features are extracted: Mean, Weighted mean, Geometric mean, Weighted geometric mean, Entropy, Weighted entropy, Range, Weighted range. Standard deviation, Weighted standard deviation. Here, the details of each property will be explained

* **number_of_elements:** number of element needed to produce a particular material. For example, the number of elements for _Ba0.2La1.8Cu1O4_ is 4 which are Ba, La, Cu, and O.
* **Atomic Mass:** the mass of an atom
* **First Ionization Energy:** the energy required to remove one mole of the most loosely held electrons from one mole of gaseous atoms to produce 1 mole of gaseous ions each with a charge of 1+
* **Atomic Radius:** a measure of the size of its atoms, usually the mean or typical distance from the center of the nucleus to the boundary of the surrounding shells of electrons.
* **Density:** the density of the nucleus of an atom
* **Electron Affinity:** the amount of energy released or spent when an electron is added to a neutral atom or molecule in the gaseous state to form a negative ion
* **Fusion Heat:** the change in its enthalpy resulting from providing energy, typically heat, to a specific quantity of the substance to change its state from a solid to a liquid, at constant pressure
* **Thermal Conductivity:** a measure of its ability to conduct heat
* **Valence:** a measure of its combining power with other atoms when it forms chemical compounds or molecules
* **critical_temp:** the temperature at which the electrical resistivity of a metal drops to zero

All the definitions are taken from external resource [@wiki:English_Wikipedia].

As described above, ten features are extraced from each of the eight main properties. Here, the details of extraction process will be provided.

\begin{align*}
Mean (\mu) & = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}t_i \\
Weighted \: Mean (v) & = \sum_{i=1}^{n}p_it_i \\
Geometric \: Mean  & = \sqrt{\prod_{i=1}^nt_i} \\
Weighted \: Geometric\: Mean & = \prod_{i=1}^nt_i^{p_i} \\
Entropy & = -\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_iln(w_i)\\
Weighted\:Entropy & = -\sum_{i=1}^{n}z_iln(z_i)\\
Range & = t_{max} - t_{min} \\
Weighted\:Range & = p_{max}t_{max} - p_{max}t_{max} \\
Standard\:Deviation & = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(t_i-\mu)^2}}\\
Weighted\:Standard\:Deviation & = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_i{(t_i-\mu)^2}} \\
\textrm{Where:} \\
t_i: & \textrm{ thermal conductivity coefficients of element i} \\
p_i: & \textrm{ the ratio of element i in the corresponding material} \\
w_i: & \textrm{ the fractions of total thermal conductivities} \\
z_i: & \textrm{ intermetidate value based on } p_i \textrm{ and } w_i \\
t_{max}: & \textrm{ the maximum thermal conductivity coefficient} \\
t_{min}: & \textrm{ the minimum thermal conductivity coefficient} \\
p_{max}: & \textrm{ the ratio of the element with maximum thermal conductivity coefficient} \\
p_{min}: & \textrm{ the ratio of the element with minimum thermal conductivity coefficient} \\
\end{align*}

In order to ease the exploration and analysis processes, we will store the index and name of the properties for later use.
```{r}
# Store the index of each main property for later use
data_index <- list(1, c(2:11), c(12:21), c(22:31), c(32:41), c(42:51), c(52:61), c(62:71), 
                   c(72:81), 82)

property_name <- c("Number of Elements", "Atomic Mass", "First Ionization Energy",
                   "Atomic Radius","Density","Electron Affinity","Fusion Heat",
                   "Thermal Conductivity","Valence","Critical Temperature")
```


\subsubsection{Element Dataset}
In this subsection, we will describe the meaning of each column and its datatype of the element dataset.
```{r}
# Description of the Element Dataset
str(chemical)
```

From the above information, it can be seen that from column 1 to 82 are the chemical elements, whereas column critical_temp is the temperature at which the electrical resistivity of a metal drops to zero and the last column is the material that is formed from the corresponding elements. In addition, only one variable (material) is factor variable, all other variables are numeric variables.

**Since this dataset only contains the chemical formula for the corresponding material, we will not use this dataset for the rest of this project**


\newpage
\section{Data Exploration}
In this section we will perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). In general, this section will contain descriptive, correlation and distribution analysis as well as data tranformation. However, before that, we need to split the dataset into train and test datasets with proportion (80:20).

```{r}
set.seed(seed)

ind <- createDataPartition(data$critical_temp, p = .8, list = FALSE)

# Split data into train and test
train.data <- data[ind,]
test.data <- data[-ind,]
```

\subsection{Descriptive Analysis}
In this subsection, we will do some descriptive analysis on the dataset.
```{r}
# Display the Statistics Summary
round(describe(train.data), 3)
```

From the Summary result, some observations can be extracted. Here is the details.

**Number of Element**

* The number of elements for each material varies from 1 to 9, however the median is 4 and mean is 4.115 which means that the majority of the materials has less than equal to 5.

**Atomic Mass**

* There is a large range for almost all the features except entropy_atomic_mass and wtd_entropy_atomic_mass.
* mean_atomic_mass, wtd_mean_atomic_mass, gmean_atomic_mass, wtd_gmean_atomic_mass, and wtd_range_tomic_mass have Right Skewed Distribution whereas the others have Left Skewed Distribution
* mean_atomic_mass, wtd_mean_atomic_mass, gmean_atomic_mass, and wtd_gmean_atomic_mass have a quite similar characteristics of data, whereas entropy_atomic_mass has a quite similar characteristics of data with wtd_entropy_atomic_mass.

**First Ionization Energy**

* There is a large range for almost all the features except entropy_fie and wtd_entropy_fie.
* mean_fie and gmean_fie have Right Skewed Distribution whereas the others have Left Skewed Distribution
* mean_fie has a similar charateristics of data with gmean_fie 
* wtd_mean_fie and wtd_gmean_fie have a similar characteristics data.

**Atomic Radius**

* mean_atomic_radius, wtd_mean_atomic_radius, gmean_atomic_radius, and wtd_gmean_atomic_radius have a same range.
* wtd_mean_atomic_radius, gmean_atomic_radius, wtd_gmean_atomic_radius, and wtd_range_atomic_radius have Right Skewed Distribution whereas the others tend to have Left Skewed Distribution.
* mean_atomic_radius has a similar statistics information with gmean_atomic_radius
* wtd_mean_atomic_radius and wtd_gmean_atomic_radius have a similar statistics information

**Density**

* mean_Density, wtd_mean_Density, gmean_Density and range_Density have a same range of value.
* entropy_Density and wtd_entropy_Density have Left Skewed Distribution, whereas the others tend to have Right Skewed Distribution

**Electron Affinity**

* mean_ElectronAffinity, wtd_mean_ElectronAffinity, gmean_ElectronAffinity, and wtd_gmean_ElectronAffinity have a same range of value
* wtd_mean_ElectronAffinity, entropy_ElectronAffinity and wtd_entropy_ElectronAffinity have Left Skewed Distribution, whereas the others tend to have Right Skewed Distribution

**Fusion Heat**

* mean_FusionHeat, wtd_mean_FusionHeat, gmean_FusionHeat, and wtd_gmean_FusionHeat have a same range of value
* entropy_FusionHeat and wtd_entropy_FusionHeat have Left Skewed Distribution, whereas the others tend to have Right Skewed Distribution

**Thermal Conductivity**

* mean_ThermalConductivity, wtd_mean_ThermalConductivity, and gmean_ThermalConductivity have a same minimum value but not the maximum value.
* wtd_mean_ThermalConductivity, gmean_ThermalConductivity, wtd_gmean_ThermalConductivity, and wtd_range_ThermalConductivity have Right Skewed Distribution, whereas the others tend to have a approximately normal distribution (not exactly)

**Valence**

* mean_Valence, wtd_mean_Valence, gmean_Valence, and wtd_gmean_Valence have a same range of value
* entropy_Valence and wtd_entropy_Valence have Left Skewed Distribution, whereas the others tend to have Right Skewed Distribution

**Critical Temperature**

* The range of crital_temp is 185, however, the standard deviation is 34.254 and mean is 34.421 which means this feature has Right Skewed Distribution.  
  
From all the above analysis, we know that most of the variables have skewed distribution, therefore, we might need to perform data transformation in the future step. In addition, we also know that the range of entropy related variables is very small compared to the other variables, therefore, we might need to do scaling in the model development section.

For the next step, we will visualize the value of each column through boxplot visualisation.

```{r figneb, fig.width=7,fig.height=6,fig.cap="Number of Element Boxplot"}
# Boxplot visualisation for the number of elements
boxplot(train.data[,1], type="l", cex.main = 0.8, col = 'lightblue', ylab="Value")
```

From Figure \@ref(fig:figneb), the median of number of elements is 4 and there is only a few materials that has 9 number of elements. 


```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=6,fig.cap=paste(property_name[2:9],"Boxplot")}
# Boxplot visualisation for the eight main properties
i <- 2
for(col in data_index[2:9]){
  boxplot(train.data[,col], type="l", cex.main = 0.8, 
          col = 'lightblue', ylab="Value", xaxt = "n")
  axis(1, at = c(1:10), labels = names(train.data)[(10*i - 18):(10*i - 9)], cex.axis = 0.5)
  i <- i+1
  cat('\n\n')
}
```

From the above figures, we can see that 

* For each property, the entropy and weighted entropy have different range of values, this makes sense since they are the entropy.
* All property have similar pattern of distribution, except First Ionization Energy and Valence.
* The majority of the variables have a very skewed distribution, this is why in the future step we need to perform data transformation.


```{r figctb, fig.width=7,fig.height=6,fig.cap="Critical Temperature Boxplot"}
# Boxplot visualisation for the critical temperature
boxplot(train.data[,82], type="l", cex.main = 0.8, col = 'lightblue', ylab="Value")
```

From Figure \@ref(fig:figctb), we can see that the median of critical temperature is 20 and there is a few value which is greater than 150. In addition, the distribution of critical temparature is Right Skewed, this can be seen from the boxplot visualisation.

\subsection{Correlation Analysis}
In this subsection, we will do some correlation analysis. First, we will plot the correlation matrix between features.
```{r}
# Correlation Matrix
corrmatrix <- cor(train.data)

# Correlation Matrix Function based on P-Value
cor.mtest <- function(mat, conf.level){
  mat <- as.matrix(mat)
  n <- ncol(mat)
  p.mat <- lowCI.mat <- uppCI.mat <- matrix(NA, n, n)
  diag(p.mat) <- 0
  diag(lowCI.mat) <- diag(uppCI.mat) <- 1
    for(i in 1:(n-1)){
      for(j in (i+1):n){
        tmp <- cor.test(mat[,i], mat[,j], conf.level = conf.level)
        p.mat[i,j] <- p.mat[j,i] <- tmp$p.value
        lowCI.mat[i,j] <- lowCI.mat[j,i] <- tmp$conf.int[1]
        uppCI.mat[i,j] <- uppCI.mat[j,i] <- tmp$conf.int[2]
      }
    }
  return(list(p.mat, lowCI.mat, uppCI.mat))
}
```


```{r figcm,  fig.width=7,fig.height=6,fig.cap="Correlation Matrix"}
# Correlation Matrix with 0.001 p-value
res1 <- cor.mtest(corrmatrix,0.999)
col1 <- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(9,"BrBG"))

# Visualize the correlation matrix
corrplot(cor(train.data),method = "square", order = "original", tl.col = "black", 
         tl.cex = 0.25, p.mat = res1[[1]], sig.level = 0.001, insig = "pch", 
         pch.cex = 0.3, col = col1(100))
cor(train.data$entropy_fie, train.data$critical_temp)
```

However, based on the 0.001 significant level, we can see that some features has been crossed out, we will exclude these columns in one of the model development scenarios, therefore, for now we will store it in a list.

```{r}
# Store the less correlated features
less_correlated <- c("gmean_fie","mean_atomic_radius","mean_ElectronAffinity",
                     "wtd_gmean_ElectronAffinity", "range_FusionHeat","std_FusionHeat",
                     "wtd_std_FusionHeat","wtd_entropy_ThermalConductivity",
                     "range_Valence","std_Valence", "wtd_std_Valence")
```

Next, we will plot the distribution of critical temperature based on the number of elements of the materials.

**Number of Elements**
```{r figctdne,  fig.width=7,fig.height=6,fig.cap="Critical Temperature Distribution on Number of Elements"}
# Visualize the Distribution of Critical Temperature on Number of Elements
ggplot(aes(x=critical_temp),data =train.data) + 
  geom_density(aes(fill = number_of_elements)) +
  facet_wrap(~number_of_elements)
```

From Figure \@ref(fig:figctdne) we can see that the different number of elements have different distribution of critical temperature. Materials with less than equal to three elements have a Right Skewed distribution of critical temperature, whereas materials with 4,5,6, and 8 elements have bimodal distribution. Meanwhile, the rests tend to have normal distribution.

**Atomic Mass, First Ionization Energy, Atomic Radius, Density, Electron Affinity, Fusion Heat, Thermal Conductivity, and Valence**
```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap=paste(property_name[2:9], "Property on Critical Temperature")}
# Visualise the atomic mass on critical temperature
for (item in data_index[2:9]){
  print(train.data[,append(item,82)] %>%
      gather(-critical_temp, key = "var", value = "value") %>%
      ggplot(aes(x = critical_temp, y = value)) +
        geom_point(shape=18, color="#56B4E9") +
        facet_wrap(~ var, scales = "free", ncol = 3) +
        geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE, color="red"))
  cat('\n\n')
}
```

From the above figures, we can see that most of the trendlines are (almost) flat which means they have no correlation, and this supports the previous analysis of the correlation matrix. Some data transformation technique might change the correlation level. Therefore, the next step is data transformation.

\subsection{Data Transformation}
In this subsection, we will do data transformation. First, we will create a new dataframe to store the transformation results, so that in the future step we can compare the result between using original data and transformed data.

```{r}
# Create a duplicate dataset
train.data.trans <- train.data
test.data.trans <- test.data
```

**Number of Element**
```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=5,fig.cap="Number of Elements Histogram"}
 hist(train.data$number_of_elements, main = "", xlab = "")
```

We will not transform the number_of_elements variable, because it is a discrete variable.

**Atomic Mass, First Ionization Energy, Atomic Radius, Density, Electron Affinity, Fusion Heat, Thermal Conductivity, and Valence**

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=10,fig.cap=paste(property_name[2:9],"Histogram")}
# Boxplot visualisation for the eight main properties
for(col in data_index[2:9]){
  par(mfrow = c(5,2))
  for (each in col){
    hist(train.data[,each], main = colnames(train.data)[each], xlab = "")
  }
  cat('\n\n')
}
```

From the above figures, we can see that most of the variables have skewed distribution, therefore, we will apply the data transformation step to them, since the number of features is too many, therefore, we will use a function to perform a Box Cox Tranformation to the feature that has skewness greater than 0.75. Box Cox transformation is a way to transform non-normal dependent variables into a normal shape. More about Box Cox Tranformation at @BoxCoxTr36:online

```{r}
# Skewness Calculation
skewed_feats <- sapply(names(train.data[,c(2:81)]), function(x) {
    skewness(train.data[[x]])
})

# Features skewness greater than the threshold (0.75)
skewed_feats <- skewed_feats[abs(skewed_feats) > 0.75]

## Transform skewed features with boxcox transformation
for (x in names(train.data[,c(2:81)])) {
  if(x %in% names(skewed_feats)){
      bc = BoxCoxTrans(train.data[[x]])
      train.data.trans[[x]] <- predict(bc, train.data[[x]])
      test.data.trans[[x]] <- predict(bc, test.data[[x]])
  }
}
```

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=10,fig.cap=paste(property_name[2:9],"Histogram After Transformation")}
# Boxplot visualisation for the eight main properties
for(col in data_index[2:9]){
  par(mfrow = c(5,2))
  for (each in col){
    hist(train.data.trans[,each], main = colnames(train.data.trans)[each], xlab = "")
  }
  cat('\n\n')
}
```


From the above figures, we can see the distrubtion after transformation which tend to more normal compared to the previous result.

**Critical Temperature**

```{r}
# Check skewness for critical temperature
skewness(train.data$critical_temp)
```

From the result, it can be seen that the skewness of critical temperature is quite high, therefore, we need to perform the Box Cox transformation. We can also check it with QQ Plot and Histogram Plot.

```{r figctqp, fig.width=7,fig.height=5,fig.cap="Critical Temperature QQ Plot"}
# QQ Plot for Critical Temperature
qqnorm(train.data[,82], main = ""); qqline(train.data[,82], col = 2,lwd=2,lty=2, main = "")
```

```{r figcth, fig.width=7,fig.height=5,fig.cap="Critical Temperature Histogram"}
# Visualise the critical temperature distribution
hist(train.data$critical_temp, 
     xlab="Critical Temperature", main = "")
```

From Figure \@ref(fig:figctqp) and \@ref(fig:figcth), critical temperature variable has a Right Skewed Distribution. Next, we will apply the transformation.

```{r}
bc_temp <- BoxCoxTrans(train.data$critical_temp)
train.data.trans$critical_temp <- predict(bc_temp, train.data$critical_temp)
```

```{r figctqpat, fig.width=7,fig.height=5,fig.cap="Critical Temperature QQ Plot After Transformation"}
qqnorm(train.data.trans$critical_temp, main = ""); 
qqline(train.data.trans$critical_temp, col = 2, lwd=2,lty=2)
```

```{r figcthat, fig.width=7,fig.height=5,fig.cap="Critical Temperature Histogram After Transformation"}
hist(train.data.trans$critical_temp, xlab="Critical Temperature", main = "")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:figctqpat) and \@ref(fig:figcthat) show the QQ Plot and Histogram after transformation, which is more normal than before.

Now, we have done the data exploration section. Some of the major findings during this process are as follows.

* Most of the variables have skewed distribution, therefore, we might try a scenario with transformed data.
* Most of the variables has no strong correlation to either response variable or other independent variables. This is because the originally the dataset only have eight main properties + 1 variable number of elements, whereas the rest of the variables are derived from them.
* Entropy-related variables have very small range compared to other variables, therefore, we need to scale the data.


\section{Model Development}

In this section, we will develop some models for this assessment. In general, we will develop 14 models by using regression, regularization, instance-based, tree-based, dimensionality reduction, and ensemble algorithms. Notice that we will transform the dataset, therefore in total we will have 28 models. In order to support this, we will use a package called caret. The caret package (short for Classification And REgression Training) is a set of functions that attempt to streamline the process for creating predictive models. The package contains tools for data splitting, pre-processing, feature selection, model tuning using resampling, and variable importance estimation. More about caret can be found here [@Thecaret98:online]

In this section, we will not explain the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm too deep, this is because we want this section only focus on the model development and fitting. Later in the model evaluation section, we will evaluate and elaborate the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm deeply.

In the first subsection, we will develop the models for the original dataset and in the second subsection, we will develop the models for the transformed dataset. 

\subsection{Original Dataset}
\subsubsection{Linear Regression with All Variables (81)}

Linear regression is a linear approach to model the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). First, we will create a model with all the features (81 features), later we will improve the model with the finding from the previous section, stepwise techniques, and regularization techniques.


```{r}
set.seed(seed)

# this is our control setting for all models, we perform 10-folds cross validation to all models
control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)

# Linear Model 
linear_model1 <- train(critical_temp ~., 
                       data = train.data,
                       method = "lm",
                       preProc = c("range"),
                       trControl = control 
                       )

summary(linear_model1)

cat("MSE :",linear_model1$results$RMSE^2)
```

From above, we can see that the R-squared for the model is 0.7348 with Adjusted R-squared is 0.7335.

Notice that from the summary, we have some information, residuals, estimate, standard error, t-value and Pr(>t). Residuals are essentially the difference between the actual observed response values and the response values. Standard Error measures the average amount that the coefficient estimates vary from the actual average value of the response variable. The coefficient t-value is a measure of how many standard deviations our coefficient estimate is far away from 0. We want it to be far away from zero as this would indicate we could reject the null hypothesis. In general, t-values are also used to compute p-values. The Pr(>t) acronym found in the model output relates to the probability of observing any value equal or larger than t. A small p-value for the intercept and the slope indicates that we can reject the null hypothesis which allows us to conclude that there is a relationship between the predictor and and response variable.

Therefore, the summary tells us about the features which are not important such as wtd_entropy_atomic_mass, wtd_range_atomic_mass, wtd_mean_fie, wtd_gmean_fie, wtd_std_fie, wtd_mean_Density, wtd_range_Density, gmean_ThermalConductivity, wtd_entropy_ThermalConductivity, wtd_std_ThermalConductivity, and wtd_range_Valence.

The Train MSE for this model is 313.6732 

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variable Importance for Linear Regression Model 1"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(linear_model1, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```

From above, it can be seen that std_ElectronAffinity is the most important variable for this model, whereas wtd_range_Density is the least important variable for this model.

\subsubsection{Linear Regression with Significant Variables}
```{r}
set.seed(seed)

# Store the less importance variables
less_important <- c("wtd_entropy_atomic_mass","wtd_range_atomic_mass","wtd_mean_fie",
                    "wtd_gmean_fie","wtd_std_fie","wtd_mean_Density","wtd_range_Density",
                    "gmean_ThermalConductivity","wtd_entropy_ThermalConductivity",
                    "wtd_std_ThermalConductivity","wtd_range_Valence")

# Linear Model 
linear_model2 <- train(critical_temp ~., 
                       data = train.data[, -which(names(train.data) %in% less_important)],
                       method = "lm",
                       preProc = c("range"),
                       trControl = control
                       )

summary(linear_model2)

cat("MSE :",linear_model2$results$RMSE^2)
```

From above, we can see that the R-squared for the model is 0.7339 with Adjusted R-squared is 0.7328 Those 2 parameters are slightly worse than the previous model. For the R-Squared, the difference is only 0.0009, whereas the different for the Adjusted R-squared is 0.0007. However, we decrease the number of variables from 81 variables to 70 variables, which is better in term of complexity.

The Train MSE for this model is 314.3748 

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variable Importance for Linear Regression Model 2"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(linear_model2, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```


From above, it can be seen that wtd_gmean_ThermalConductivity is the most important variable for this model, whereas gmean_atomic_radius is the least important variable for this model.


\subsubsection{Linear Regression with Strong Correlated Variables}

```{r}
set.seed(seed)

# Linear Model 
linear_model3 <- train(critical_temp ~., 
                       data = train.data[, -which(names(train.data) %in% less_correlated)],
                       method = "lm",
                       preProc = c("range"),
                       trControl = control
                       )

summary(linear_model3)

cat("MSE :",linear_model3$results$RMSE^2)
```

From above, we can see that the R-squared for the model is 0.7265 with Adjusted R-squared is 0.7254. Those 2 parameters are slightly worse than the first model. For the R-Squared, the difference is only 0.0083, whereas the different for the Adjusted R-squared is 0.0081. However, we decrease the number of variables from 81 variables to 70 variables, which is better in term of complexity.

The Train MSE for this model is 323.0719 

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variable Importance for Linear Regression Model 3"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(linear_model3, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```

From above, it can be seen that wtd_mean_ThermalConductivity is the most important variable for this model, whereas gmean_ThermalConductivity is the least important variable for this model.

\subsubsection{Linear Regression with Backwards Selection}

The stepwise regression (or stepwise selection) consists of iteratively adding and removing predictors, in the predictive model, in order to find the subset of variables in the data set resulting in the best performing model, that is a model that lowers prediction error.

There are three strategies of stepwise regression [@bruce2017practical]

* Backward selection (or backward elimination), which starts with all predictors in the model (full model), iteratively removes the least contributive predictors, and stops when you have a model where all predictors are statistically significant.

* Forward selection, which starts with no predictors in the model, iteratively adds the most contributive predictors, and stops when the improvement is no longer statistically significant.

* Stepwise selection (or sequential replacement), which is a combination of forward and backward selections. You start with no predictors, then sequentially add the most contributive predictors (like forward selection). After adding each new variable, remove any variables that no longer provide an improvement in the model fit (like backward selection).

In this sub section, we will perform the backward selection and in the next subsections, we will perform forward and stepwise selection.

```{r}
# Helper Function for Plotting Metrics
plot_metrics <- function(model, x_axis, x_label) {
  par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
  plot(y = model$results$Rsquared, x = x_axis, xlab = x_label, 
       ylab = "R-Squared", type = "l")
  points(x_axis[max(which(model$results$Rsquared == max(model$results$Rsquared)))], 
         max(model$results$Rsquared), 
         col = "red", cex = 2, pch = 20)
  plot(model$results$RMSE^2, x = x_axis, xlab = x_label, ylab = "MSE", type = "l")
  points(x_axis[max(which(model$results$RMSE == min(model$results$RMSE)))],
         min(model$results$RMSE)^2, 
         col = "red", cex = 2, pch = 20)
  plot(model$results$MAE, x = x_axis, xlab = x_label, ylab = "MAE", type = "l")
  points(x_axis[max(which(model$results$MAE == min(model$results$MAE)))], 
         min(model$results$MAE), 
         col = "red", cex = 2, pch = 20)
}
```


```{r}
set.seed(seed)

# Linear Regression with Backward Selection
linear_backward <- train(critical_temp ~., data = train.data,
                    method = "leapBackward", 
                    tuneGrid = data.frame(nvmax = 1:(ncol(train.data)-1)),
                    trControl = control,
                    preProc = c("range")
                    )
summary(linear_backward)
```

```{r}
linear_backward$results
```

From the above results, we can see how backward selection works and the corresponding errors to the number of variables. Here, we will plot and see the optimal number of variables.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=7,fig.cap="R-Squared, MSE, and MAE for Backward Selection"}
plot_metrics(linear_backward, linear_backward$results$nvmax, "Number of Variables")
```

```{r}
linear_backward$bestTune
```

```{r}
coef(linear_backward$finalModel, linear_backward$bestTune$nvmax)
```


```{r}
getTrainPerf(linear_backward)
```


From the above metrics, it can be seen that based on R-Squared and MSE, the best model is the model with 78 variables, however, MAE choose a model with less variables. By using the feature from caret package, we can decide that the best model is the model with 78 variables. The list of 78 variables is provided above. The R-Squared for this model is 0.7326597 with Train MSE is 313.66.

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.


```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variable Importance for Backward Selection"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(linear_backward, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```

From above, it can be seen that wtd_std_ThermalConductivity is the most important variable for this model, whereas gmean_fie is the least important variable for this model.


\subsubsection{Linear Regression with Forward Selection}

In this sub section, we will perform the forward selection and in the next subsection, we will perform stepwise selection.


```{r}
set.seed(seed)

# Linear Regression with Forward Selection
linear_forward <- train(critical_temp ~., data = train.data,
                    method = "leapForward", 
                    tuneGrid = data.frame(nvmax = 1:(ncol(train.data)-1)),
                    trControl = control,
                    preProc = c("range")
                    )
summary(linear_forward)
```

```{r}
linear_forward$results
```

From the above results, we can see how forward selection works and the corresponding errors to the number of variables. Here, we will plot and see the optimal number of variables.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=6,fig.cap="R-Squared, MSE, and MAE for Forward Selection"}
plot_metrics(linear_forward, linear_forward$results$nvmax, "Number of Variables")
```


```{r}
linear_forward$bestTune
```

```{r}
coef(linear_forward$finalModel, linear_forward$bestTune$nvmax)
```

```{r}
getTrainPerf(linear_forward)
```

From the above metrics, it can be seen that based on R-Squared and MSE, the best model is the model with 77 variables, however, MAE choose a model with less variables. By using the feature from caret package, we can decide that the best model is the model with 77 variables. The list of 77 variables is provided above. The R-Squared for this model is 0.7326 with Train MSE is 313.64

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variables Importance for Forward Selection"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(linear_forward, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```


From above, it can be seen that wtd_std_ThermalConductivity is the most important variable for this model, whereas gmean_fie is the least important variable for this model.

\subsubsection{Linear Regression with Stepwise Selection}

In this sub section, we will perform the stepwise selection which is the combination of forward and backward selections.

```{r}
set.seed(seed)

# Linear Regression with Stepwise Selection
linear_stepwise <- train(critical_temp ~., data = train.data,
                    method = "leapSeq", 
                    tuneGrid = data.frame(nvmax = 1:(ncol(train.data)-1)),
                    trControl = control,
                    preProc = c("range")
                    )

summary(linear_stepwise)

```

```{r}
linear_stepwise$results
```

From the above results, we can see how stepwise selection works and the corresponding errors to the number of variables. Here, we will plot and see the optimal number of variables.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=6,fig.cap="R-Squared, MSE, and MAE for Stepwise Selection"}
plot_metrics(linear_stepwise, linear_stepwise$results$nvmax, "Number of Variables")
```


```{r}
linear_stepwise$bestTune
```

```{r}
coef(linear_stepwise$finalModel, linear_stepwise$bestTune$nvmax)
```


```{r}
getTrainPerf(linear_stepwise)
```

From the above metrics, it can be seen that based on R-Squared and MSE, the best model is the model with 81 variables, however, MAE choose a model with less variables. By using the feature from caret package, we can decide that the best model is the model with 81 variables. The list of 81 variables is provided above. The R-Squared for this model is 0.7326498 with Train MSE is 313.6441

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variables Importance for Stepwise Selection"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(linear_stepwise, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```


From above, it can be seen that wtd_std_ThermalConductivity is the most important variable for this model, whereas gmean_fie is the least important variable for this model.

From above, we can see that both backward, forward and stepwise selection have almost the same train R-Squared and MSE. However, backward selection produces the least complexity model with 77 variables, whereas forward selection and stepwise selection have 78 and 81 variables consecutively. Therefore, we can conclude that backward selection gives a better result among them

\subsubsection{Ridge Regression}

The standard linear model  performs poorly in a situation, where you have a large multivariate data set containing a number of variables superior to the number of samples.

A better alternative is the penalized regression allowing to create a linear regression model that is penalized, for having too many variables in the model, by adding a constraint in the equation [@bruce2017practical]. This is also known as shrinkage or regularization methods.

The consequence of imposing this penalty, is to reduce the coefficient values towards zero. This allows the less contributive variables to have a coefficient close to zero or equal zero.

Note that, the shrinkage requires the selection of a tuning parameter (lambda) that determines the amount of shrinkage.

In this sub section, we will perform Ridge regression. Ridge regression shrinks the regression coefficients, so that variables, with minor contribution to the outcome, have their coefficients close to zero.

The shrinkage of the coefficients is achieved by penalizing the regression model with a penalty term called L2-norm, which is the sum of the squared coefficients.

The amount of the penalty can be fine-tuned using a constant called lambda. Here we provide a sequence of lambda values, later we will find which value gives the best result.

```{r}
set.seed(seed)

lambda_seq <- seq(0.01, 1, length = 15)

# Ridge Regression
ridge_model <- train(
  critical_temp ~., data = train.data, method = "ridge",
  trControl = control,
  tuneGrid = expand.grid(lambda = lambda_seq),
  preProc = c("range")
  )

ridge_model$results
```

From the above results, we can see the corresponding errors to the lambda values Here, we will plot and see the optimal lambda.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=5,fig.cap="R-Squared, MSE, and MAE for Ridge Regression"}
plot_metrics(ridge_model, ridge_model$results$lambda, "Lambda")
```


```{r}
ridge_model$bestTune$lambda
```

From above, we know that the best lambda is 0.01. Next we will show the coefficient after regularization.

```{r}
varImp(ridge_model)$importance
```

```{r}
getTrainPerf(ridge_model)
```

From the above metrics, the R-Squared for this model is 0.715474 with Train MSE is 333.868

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variables Importance for Ridge Regression"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(ridge_model, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```

From above, it can be seen that wtd_std_ThermalConductivity is the most important variable for this model, whereas gmean_fie is the least important variable for this model.


\subsubsection{Lasso Regression}

Lasso shrinks the regression coefficients toward zero by penalizing the regression model with a penalty term called L1-norm, which is the sum of the absolute coefficients.

In the case of lasso regression, the penalty has the effect of forcing some of the coefficient estimates, with a minor contribution to the model, to be exactly equal to zero. This means that, lasso can be also seen as an alternative to the subset selection methods for performing variable selection in order to reduce the complexity of the model.

The amount of the penalty for Lasso also can be fine-tuned using a constant called lambda. Here we provide a sequence of lambda values, later we will find which value gives the best result.

```{r}
set.seed(seed)

# Lasso Regression
lasso_model <- train(
  critical_temp ~., data = train.data, method = "glmnet",
  trControl = control,
  tuneGrid = expand.grid(alpha = 1, lambda = lambda_seq),
  preProc = c("range")
  )

lasso_model$results
```


```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=5,fig.cap="R-Squared, MSE, and MAE for Lasso Regression"}
plot_metrics(lasso_model, lasso_model$results$lambda, "Lambda")
```


```{r}
lasso_model$bestTune$lambda
```

From above, we know that the best lambda is 0.01. Next, we will plot the list of coefficients for this model.

```{r}
coef(lasso_model$finalModel, lasso_model$bestTune$lambda)
```

```{r}
getTrainPerf(lasso_model)
```

From the above metrics, the R-Squared for this model is 0.7285869 with Train MSE is 318.45

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variables Importance for Lasso Regression"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(lasso_model, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```

From the plot, we can see that some variables have zero importance, this is because lasso some of the variables' coefficient to zero, which is different compared to ridge regression. In addition, the most important variable is gmean_atomic_radius.


\subsubsection{Elastic Net}

Elastic Net produces a regression model that is penalized with both the L1 and L2 regularizations The consequence of this is to effectively shrink coefficients and to set some coefficients to zero.

The amount of the penalty for Elastic Net also can be fine-tuned using a constant called lambda. Here we provide a sequence of lambda values, later we will find which value gives the best result.

```{r}
set.seed(seed)

# Elastic Net Regression
elastic_net_model <- train(
  critical_temp ~., data = train.data, method = "glmnet",
  trControl = control,
  tuneGrid = expand.grid(alpha = 0.5, lambda = lambda_seq),
  preProc = c("range")
  )

elastic_net_model$results
```

From the above results, we can see the corresponding errors to the lambda values Here, we will plot and see the optimal lambda.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=5,fig.cap="R-Squared, MSE, and MAE for Elastic Net Regression"}
plot_metrics(elastic_net_model, elastic_net_model$results$lambda, "Lambda")
```


```{r}
elastic_net_model$bestTune$lambda
```

From above, we know that the best lambda is 0.01. Next, we will plot the list of coefficients for this model.

```{r}
coef(elastic_net_model$finalModel, elastic_net_model$bestTune$lambda)
```

```{r}
getTrainPerf(elastic_net_model)
```

From the above metrics, the R-Squared for this model is 0.7295577 with Train MSE is 317.28

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variables Importance for Elastic Net Regression"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(elastic_net_model, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```


From the plot, we can see that some variables have zero importance, however, compared to lasso regression, the number of zero importance is less. This is because elastic net is the combination between ridge and lasso regressions. In addition, the most important variable for this model is gmean_atomic_radius.


\subsubsection{Principal Component Regression}

The principal component regression (PCR) first applies Principal Component Analysis on the data set to summarize the original predictor variables into few new variables also known as principal components (PCs), which are a linear combination of the original data. Here we will try to force the model to only have maximum 40 number of components.

```{r}
set.seed(seed)

# Principal Component Regression
pcr_model <- train(critical_temp ~ .,
             data       = train.data,
             method     = "pcr",
             tuneGrid   = expand.grid(ncomp = seq(2,40,2)),
             trControl  = control,
             preProc = c("range"))
summary(pcr_model)
```

```{r}
pcr_model$results
```

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=5,fig.cap="R-Squared, MSE, and MAE for Principal Component Regression"}
plot_metrics(pcr_model, pcr_model$results$ncomp, "Number of Component")
```


```{r}
pcr_model$bestTune
```

From the above results, we can see the corresponding errors to the number of principal components. Here, we will plot and see the optimal number of principal components.


```{r}
getTrainPerf(pcr_model)
```

```{r}
varImp(pcr_model)$importance
```

From the above metrics, the R-Squared for this model is 0.6924624 with Train MSE is 360.84. However, now the model only has 40 variables as the predictors which is far from the original model.

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variables Importance for Principal Component Regression"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(pcr_model, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```

From above, it can be seen that wtd_std_ThermalConductivity is the most important variable for this model, whereas gmean_fie is the least important variable for this model.


\subsubsection{K-Nearest Neighbor Regression}

K-Nearest Neighbor is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. For regression, the prediction is the average of the response variable of the closest neighbors. Here we will let the cross validation to choose number of k between 1 and 5.

```{r}
set.seed(seed)

# K-Nearest Neighbor Regression
knn_model <- train(critical_temp ~ .,
             method     = "knn",
             tuneGrid   = expand.grid(k = c(1:5)),
             trControl  = control,
             data       = train.data,
             preProc = c("range"))

knn_model$results
```

From the above results, we can see the corresponding errors to the number of k. Here, we will plot and see the optimal number of k.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=5,fig.cap="R-Squared, MSE, and MAE for KNN Regression"}
plot_metrics(knn_model, knn_model$results$k, "k")
```

```{r}
# Best tuning parameter k that minimize the RMSE
knn_model$bestTune
```

```{r}
getTrainPerf(knn_model)
```

From the result, we know that the best k is 2 with R-Squared 0.9057 and MSE 111.67. So far, this is the best model we have.

Here, we show the variable importance for this model.

```{r}
varImp(knn_model, scale = FALSE)$importance
```

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variables Importance for KNN Regression"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(knn_model, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```

From above, it can be seen that wtd_std_ThermalConductivity is the most important variable for this model, whereas gmean_fie is the least important variable for this model.




\subsubsection{Random Forest}

Random forest provides a strong improvement, which consists of applying bagging to the data and bootstrap sampling to the predictor variables at each split [@bruce2017practical]. This means that at each splitting step of the tree algorithm, a random sample of n predictors is chosen as split candidates from the full set of the predictors.

Here, we will perform a random forest algorithm by using ranger library, there are three main parameter to be tuned which are mtry, splitrule and min.node.size. mtry is number of variables to possibly split at in each node. Default is the (rounded down) square root of the number variables. 

```{r}
set.seed(seed)

# Random Forest
random_forest_model <- train(
  critical_temp ~., data = train.data,
  trControl = trainControl( method = "cv", number = 10, search = "random"),
  tuneLength = 5,
  method = "ranger",
  importance = 'impurity',
  preProc = c("range")
)

random_forest_model$results
```

From the above results, we can see the corresponding errors to the number of mtry, splitrule, and minimum node size. Here, we will plot and see the optimal number of those three parameters.


```{r}
random_forest_model$bestTune
```


```{r}
getTrainPerf(random_forest_model)
```

From above, we can see that the optimal model is the model with mtry = 19, splitrule = variance and min.node.size = 13 with R-Squared = 0.9226495 and MSE = 91.07

Here, we show the variable importance for this model.

```{r}
varImp(random_forest_model, scale = FALSE)$importance
```

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variables Importance for Random Forest"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(random_forest_model, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```

From above, it can be seen that range_ThermalConductivity is the most important variable for this model, whereas number_of_elements is the least important variable for this model.


\subsubsection{Gradient Boosting Machine}

Compared to random forests which build an ensemble of deep independent trees, GBMs build an ensemble of shallow and weak successive trees with each tree learning and improving on the previous. When combined, these many weak successive trees produce a powerful combination that are often hard to beat with other algorithms.

For a gradient boosting machine (GBM) model, there are four main tuning parameters, n.trees (number of iterations), interaction.depth (complexity of the tree), shrinkage (learning rate), and m.minobsinnode (the minimum number of trianing set samples in a node to commence splitting).

For the parameters tuning process, we can use apply manual grid search, random grid search or random search tuning. Grid search technique for some cases are more effective, however, it is very time consuming and need much computational cost. Therefore, for this assignment purpose, we will only apply random search tuning with tune length = 4.

```{r}
set.seed(seed)

# Gradient Boosting Machine
gbm_model <- train(critical_temp ~ ., 
                   data = train.data, 
                   method = "gbm", 
                   tuneLength = 4,
                   preProc = c("range"),
                   trControl = trainControl( method = "cv", number = 10, search = "random"),
                   verbose = FALSE
                   )

gbm_model$results
```

```{r}
gbm_model$finalModel
```


```{r}
gbm_model$bestTune
```

```{r}
getTrainPerf(gbm_model)
```


From above, we can see that the optimal model is the model with shrinkage = 0.06237055, n.trees = 3380, interaction.depth = 9, and m.minobsinnode = 13. The R-Squared and MSE are 0.9207168 and 92.91 consecutively.

Here, we show the variable importance for this model.

```{r}
varImp(gbm_model, scale = FALSE)$importance
```

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variables Importance for Gradient Boosting Machine"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(gbm_model, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```

From above, it can be seen that range_ThermalConductivity is the most important variable for this model, whereas number_of_elements is the least important variable for this model which is same to random forest model.


\subsubsection{XG-Boost Regression}

XG-Boost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable. It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework. However, xgboost used a more regularized model formalization to control over-fitting, which gives it better performance.

For this algorithm, the main paratemers for tuning are nrounds, max_depth, eta, gamma, colsample_bytree, min_child_weight, and subsample. eta is the learning rate, gamma specifies the minimum loss reduction required to make a split, colsample_bytree denotes the fraction of columns to be randomly samples for each tree, min_child_weight defines the minimum sum of weights of all observations required in a child and subsample denotes the fraction of observations to be randomly samples for each tree.

For the parameters tuning process, we can use apply manual grid search, random grid search or random search tuning. Grid search technique for some cases are more effective, however, it is very time consuming and need much computational cost. Therefore, for this assignment purpose, we will only apply random search tuning with tune length = 4

```{r}
set.seed(seed)

# XG-Boost Regression
xgb_model <- train(
  critical_temp ~., data = train.data,
  trControl = trainControl( method = "cv", number = 10, search = "random"),
  tuneLength = 4,
  method = "xgbTree",
  verbose = FALSE,
  preProc = c("range"),
  nthread = 1
)

xgb_model$results
```

```{r}
xgb_model$finalModel
```


```{r}
xgb_model$bestTune
```

```{r}
getTrainPerf(xgb_model)
```


From above, we can see that the optimal model is the model with nrounds = 861, max_depth = 7, eta = 0.1703574, gamma = 2.862233, colsample_bytree = 0.426645, min_child_weight = 4, and subsample = 0.8735088. The R-Squared and MSE are 0.9180491 and 96.04 consecutively.

Here, we show the variable importance for this model.


```{r}
varImp(xgb_model, scale = FALSE)$importance
```

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variables Importance for XG-Boost"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(xgb_model, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```

From above, it can be seen that wtd_std_ThermalConductivity is the most important variable for this model, whereas entropy_Valence is the least important variable for this model.




\subsection{Transformed Dataset}
\subsubsection{Linear Regression with All Variables (81)}

Linear regression is a linear approach to model the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). First, we will create a model with all the features (81 features), later we will improve the model with the finding from the previous section and stepwise technique.


```{r}
set.seed(seed)

# this is control for all dataset, we perform 10-folds cross validation
control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)

# Linear Model 
linear_model1_trans <- train(critical_temp ~., 
                       data = train.data,
                       method = "lm",
                       preProc = c("center", "scale", "BoxCox"),
                       trControl = control 
                       )

summary(linear_model1_trans)

cat("MSE :",linear_model1_trans$results$RMSE^2)
```

From above, we can see that the R-squared for the model is 0.7339 with Adjusted R-squared is 0.7326

The summary tells us about the features which are not important such as wtd_entropy_atomic_mass, wtd_range_atomic_mass, wtd_mean_fie, wtd_gmean_fie, wtd_std_fie, wtd_mean_Density, wtd_range_Density, gmean_ThermalConductivity, wtd_entropy_ThermalConductivity, wtd_std_ThermalConductivity, and wtd_range_Valence.

The Train MSE for this model is 326.288 

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variable Importance for Linear Regression Model 1 Trans"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(linear_model1_trans, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```

\subsubsection{Linear Regression with Significant Variables}
```{r}
set.seed(seed)

# Store the less importance variables
less_important <- c("mean_atomic_mass","wtd_range_atomic_mass","wtd_mean_fie",
                    "wtd_gmean_fie","wtd_mean_Density","gmean_Density",
                    "entropy_Density","mean_ElectronAffinity","std_Valence")

# Linear Model 
linear_model2_trans <- train(critical_temp ~., 
                       data = train.data[, -which(names(train.data) %in% less_important)],
                       method = "lm",
                       preProc = c("center", "scale", "BoxCox"),
                       trControl = control
                       )

summary(linear_model2_trans)

cat("MSE :",linear_model2_trans$results$RMSE^2)
```

From above, we can see that the R-squared for the model is 0.7338 with Adjusted R-squared is 0.7326 Those 2 parameters are slightly worse than the previous model. For the R-Squared, the difference is only 0.0001, whereas the Adjusted R-squared is same. However, we decrease the number of variables from 81 variables to 72 variables, which is better in term of complexity.

The Train MSE for this model is 315.0956 

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variable Importance for Linear Regression Model 2 Trans"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(linear_model2_trans, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```

From above, it can be seen that range_ElectronAffinity is the most important variable for this model, whereas entropy_atomic_radius is the least important variable for this model.

\subsubsection{Linear Regression with Strong Correlated Variables}

```{r}
set.seed(seed)

# Linear Model 
linear_model3_trans <- train(critical_temp ~., 
                       data = train.data[, -which(names(train.data) %in% less_correlated)],
                       method = "lm",
                       preProc = c("center", "scale", "BoxCox"),
                       trControl = control
                       )

summary(linear_model3_trans)

cat("MSE :",linear_model3_trans$results$RMSE^2)
```

From above, we can see that the R-squared for the model is 0.7338 with Adjusted R-squared is 0.7216 Those 2 parameters are slightly worse than the previous model. For the R-Squared, the difference is only 0.0112, whereas for the Adjusted R-squared the different is 0.0110. However, we decrease the number of variables from 81 variables to 70 variables, which is better in term of complexity.


The Train MSE for this model is 334.3684 

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variable Importance for Linear Regression Model 3 Trans"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(linear_model3_trans, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```

From above, it can be seen that wtd_range_ThermalConductivity is the most important variable for this model, whereas gmean_FusionHeat is the least important variable for this model.


\subsubsection{Linear Regression with Backwards Selection}

The stepwise regression (or stepwise selection) consists of iteratively adding and removing predictors, in the predictive model, in order to find the subset of variables in the data set resulting in the best performing model, that is a model that lowers prediction error.

There are three strategies of stepwise regression [@bruce2017practical]

* Backward selection (or backward elimination), which starts with all predictors in the model (full model), iteratively removes the least contributive predictors, and stops when you have a model where all predictors are statistically significant.

* Forward selection, which starts with no predictors in the model, iteratively adds the most contributive predictors, and stops when the improvement is no longer statistically significant.

* Stepwise selection (or sequential replacement), which is a combination of forward and backward selections. You start with no predictors, then sequentially add the most contributive predictors (like forward selection). After adding each new variable, remove any variables that no longer provide an improvement in the model fit (like backward selection).

In this sub section, we will perform the backward selection and in the next subsections, we will perform forward and stepwise selection.

```{r}
# Helper Function for Plotting Metrics
plot_metrics <- function(model, x_axis, x_label) {
  par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
  plot(y = model$results$Rsquared, x = x_axis, xlab = x_label, 
       ylab = "R-Squared", type = "l")
  points(x_axis[max(which(model$results$Rsquared == max(model$results$Rsquared)))], 
         max(model$results$Rsquared), 
         col = "red", cex = 2, pch = 20)
  plot(model$results$RMSE^2, x = x_axis, xlab = x_label, ylab = "MSE", type = "l")
  points(x_axis[max(which(model$results$RMSE == min(model$results$RMSE)))],
         min(model$results$RMSE)^2, 
         col = "red", cex = 2, pch = 20)
  plot(model$results$MAE, x = x_axis, xlab = x_label, ylab = "MAE", type = "l")
  points(x_axis[max(which(model$results$MAE == min(model$results$MAE)))], 
         min(model$results$MAE), 
         col = "red", cex = 2, pch = 20)
}
```


```{r}
set.seed(seed)

# Linear Regression with Backward Selection
linear_backward_trans <- train(critical_temp ~., data = train.data,
                    method = "leapBackward", 
                    tuneGrid = data.frame(nvmax = 1:(ncol(train.data)-1)),
                    trControl = control,
                    preProc = c("center", "scale", "BoxCox")
                    )
summary(linear_backward_trans)
```

```{r}
linear_backward_trans$results
```

From the above results, we can see how backward selection works and the corresponding errors to the number of variables. Here, we will plot and see the optimal number of variables.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=7,fig.cap="R-Squared, MSE, and MAE for Backward Selection Trans"}
plot_metrics(linear_backward_trans, linear_backward_trans$results$nvmax, "Number of Variables")
```

```{r}
linear_backward_trans$bestTune
```

```{r}
coef(linear_backward_trans$finalModel, linear_backward_trans$bestTune$nvmax)
```



```{r}
getTrainPerf(linear_backward_trans)
```


From the above metrics, it can be seen that based on R-Squared and MSE, the best model is the model with 54 variables, however, MAE choose a model with more variables. By using the feature from caret package, we can decide that the best model is the model with 54 variables. The list of 54 variables is provided above. The R-Squared for this model is 0.7274711 with Train MSE is 319.69. Those metrics are slightly lower than the original linear regression, however, this model decrease the number of variables from 81 to only 54, which is good in term of model complexity.

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.


```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variable Importance for Backward Selection Trans"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(linear_backward_trans, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```

From above, it can be seen that wtd_std_ThermalConductivity is the most important variable for this model, whereas gmean_fie is the least important variable for this model.


\subsubsection{Linear Regression with Forward Selection}

In this sub section, we will perform the forward selection and in the next subsection, we will perform stepwise selection.


```{r}
set.seed(seed)

# Linear Regression with Forward Selection
linear_forward_trans <- train(critical_temp ~., data = train.data,
                    method = "leapForward", 
                    tuneGrid = data.frame(nvmax = 1:(ncol(train.data)-1)),
                    trControl = control,
                    preProc = c("center", "scale", "BoxCox")
                    )
summary(linear_forward_trans)
```

```{r}
linear_forward_trans$results
```

From the above results, we can see how forward selection works and the corresponding errors to the number of variables. Here, we will plot and see the optimal number of variables.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=6,fig.cap="R-Squared, MSE, and MAE for Forward Selection Trans"}
plot_metrics(linear_forward_trans, linear_forward_trans$results$nvmax, "Number of Variables")
```


```{r}
linear_forward_trans$bestTune
```

```{r}
coef(linear_forward_trans$finalModel, linear_forward_trans$bestTune$nvmax)
```

```{r}
getTrainPerf(linear_forward_trans)
```

From the above metrics, the best model is model with 80 variables, this is more than the one from backward selection. This is because the algorithm find the best model randomly. The R-Squared for this model is 0.7228009 with Train MSE is 326.1636

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variables Importance for Forward Selection Trans"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(linear_forward_trans, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```

From above, it can be seen that wtd_std_ThermalConductivity is the most important variable for this model, whereas gmean_fie is the least important variable for this model.


\subsubsection{Linear Regression with Stepwise Selection}

In this sub section, we will perform the stepwise selection which is the combination of forward and backward selections.

```{r}
set.seed(seed)

# Linear Regression with Stepwise Selection
linear_stepwise_trans <- train(critical_temp ~., data = train.data,
                    method = "leapSeq", 
                    tuneGrid = data.frame(nvmax = 1:(ncol(train.data)-1)),
                    trControl = control,
                    preProc = c("center", "scale", "BoxCox")
                    )

summary(linear_stepwise_trans)

```

```{r}
linear_stepwise_trans$results
```

From the above results, we can see how stepwise selection works and the corresponding errors to the number of variables. Here, we will plot and see the optimal number of variables.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=6,fig.cap="R-Squared, MSE, and MAE for Stepwise Selection Trans"}
plot_metrics(linear_stepwise_trans, linear_stepwise_trans$results$nvmax, "Number of Variables")
```


```{r}
linear_stepwise_trans$bestTune
```

```{r}
coef(linear_stepwise_trans$finalModel, linear_stepwise_trans$bestTune$nvmax)
```


```{r}
getTrainPerf(linear_stepwise_trans)
```

From the above metrics, it can be seen that based on R-Squared and MSE, the best model is the model with 58 variables, however, MAE choose a model with more variables. By using the feature from caret package, we can decide that the best model is the model with 54 variables. The list of 54 variables is provided above. The R-Squared for this model is 0.7297433 with Train MSE is 316.84. Those metrics are slightly lower than the original linear regression, however, this model decrease the number of variables from 81 to only 58, which is good in term of model complexity. In addition, this model is relatively better compared to the other stepwise models.

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variables Importance for Stepwise Selection Trans"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(linear_stepwise_trans, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```


From above, it can be seen that wtd_std_ThermalConductivity is the most important variable for this model, whereas gmean_fie is the least important variable for this model.



\subsubsection{Ridge Regression}

The standard linear model  performs poorly in a situation, where you have a large multivariate data set containing a number of variables superior to the number of samples.

A better alternative is the penalized regression allowing to create a linear regression model that is penalized, for having too many variables in the model, by adding a constraint in the equation [@bruce2017practical]. This is also known as shrinkage or regularization methods.

The consequence of imposing this penalty, is to reduce the coefficient values towards zero. This allows the less contributive variables to have a coefficient close to zero or equal zero.

Note that, the shrinkage requires the selection of a tuning parameter (lambda) that determines the amount of shrinkage.

In this sub section, we will perform Ridge regression. Ridge regression shrinks the regression coefficients, so that variables, with minor contribution to the outcome, have their coefficients close to zero.

The shrinkage of the coefficients is achieved by penalizing the regression model with a penalty term called L2-norm, which is the sum of the squared coefficients.

The amount of the penalty can be fine-tuned using a constant called lambda. Here we provide a sequence of lambda values, later we will find which value gives the best result.

```{r}
set.seed(seed)

lambda_seq <- seq(0.01, 1, length = 15)

# Ridge Regression
ridge_model_trans <- train(
  critical_temp ~., data = train.data, method = "ridge",
  trControl = control,
  tuneGrid = expand.grid(lambda = lambda_seq),
  preProc = c("center", "scale", "BoxCox")
  )

ridge_model_trans$results
```

From the above results, we can see the corresponding errors to the lambda values Here, we will plot and see the optimal lambda.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=5,fig.cap="R-Squared, MSE, and MAE for Ridge Regression Trans"}
plot_metrics(ridge_model_trans, ridge_model_trans$results$lambda, "Lambda")
```


```{r}
ridge_model_trans$bestTune$lambda
```

From above, we know that the best lambda is 0.01. Next we will show the coefficient after regularization.

```{r}
varImp(ridge_model_trans)$importance
```

```{r}
getTrainPerf(ridge_model_trans)
```

From the above metrics, the R-Squared for this model is 0.7108181 with Train MSE is 339.66

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variables Importance for Ridge Regression Trans"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(ridge_model_trans, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```

From above, it can be seen that wtd_std_ThermalConductivity is the most important variable for this model, whereas gmean_fie is the least important variable for this model.


\subsubsection{Lasso Regression}

Lasso shrinks the regression coefficients toward zero by penalizing the regression model with a penalty term called L1-norm, which is the sum of the absolute coefficients.

In the case of lasso regression, the penalty has the effect of forcing some of the coefficient estimates, with a minor contribution to the model, to be exactly equal to zero. This means that, lasso can be also seen as an alternative to the subset selection methods for performing variable selection in order to reduce the complexity of the model.

The amount of the penalty for Lasso also can be fine-tuned using a constant called lambda. Here we provide a sequence of lambda values, later we will find which value gives the best result.

```{r}
set.seed(seed)

# Lasso Regression
lasso_model_trans <- train(
  critical_temp ~., data = train.data, method = "glmnet",
  trControl = control,
  tuneGrid = expand.grid(alpha = 1, lambda = lambda_seq),
  preProc = c("center", "scale", "BoxCox")
  )

lasso_model_trans$results
```


```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=5,fig.cap="R-Squared, MSE, and MAE for Lasso Regression Trans"}
plot_metrics(lasso_model_trans, lasso_model_trans$results$lambda, "Lambda")
```


```{r}
lasso_model_trans$bestTune$lambda
```

From above, we know that the best lambda is 0.01. Next, we will plot the list of coefficients for this model.

```{r}
coef(lasso_model_trans$finalModel, lasso_model_trans$bestTune$lambda)
```

```{r}
getTrainPerf(lasso_model_trans)
```

From the above metrics, the R-Squared for this model is 0.716422 with Train MSE is 334.48

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variables Importance for Lasso Regression Trans"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(lasso_model_trans, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```

From the plot, we can see that some variables have zero importance, this is because lasso some of the variables' coefficient to zero, which is different compared to ridge regression. In addition, the most important variable is range_ElectronAffinity.


\subsubsection{Elastic Net}

Elastic Net produces a regression model that is penalized with both the L1 and L2 regularizations The consequence of this is to effectively shrink coefficients and to set some coefficients to zero.

The amount of the penalty for Elastic Net also can be fine-tuned using a constant called lambda. Here we provide a sequence of lambda values, later we will find which value gives the best result.

```{r}
set.seed(seed)

# Elastic Net Regression
elastic_net_model_trans <- train(
  critical_temp ~., data = train.data, method = "glmnet",
  trControl = control,
  tuneGrid = expand.grid(alpha = 0.5, lambda = lambda_seq),
  preProc = c("center", "scale", "BoxCox")
  )

elastic_net_model_trans$results
```

From the above results, we can see the corresponding errors to the lambda values Here, we will plot and see the optimal lambda.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=5,fig.cap="R-Squared, MSE, and MAE for Elastic Net Regression Trans"}
plot_metrics(elastic_net_model_trans, elastic_net_model_trans$results$lambda, "Lambda")
```


```{r}
elastic_net_model_trans$bestTune$lambda
```

From above, we know that the best lambda is 0.01. Next, we will plot the list of coefficients for this model.

```{r}
coef(elastic_net_model_trans$finalModel, elastic_net_model_trans$bestTune$lambda)
```

```{r}
getTrainPerf(elastic_net_model_trans)
```

From the above metrics, the R-Squared for this model is 0.7182826 with Train MSE is 331.96

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variables Importance for Elastic Net Regression Trans"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(elastic_net_model_trans, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```


From the plot, we can see that some variables have zero importance, however, compared to lasso regression, the number of zero importance is less. This is because elastic net is the combination between ridge and lasso regressions. In addition, the most important variable for this model is range_ElectronAffinity.




\subsubsection{Principal Component Regression}

The principal component regression (PCR) first applies Principal Component Analysis on the data set to summarize the original predictor variables into few new variables also known as principal components (PCs), which are a linear combination of the original data.

These PCs are then used to build the linear regression model. The number of principal components, to incorporate in the model, is chosen by cross-validation (cv). 


```{r}
set.seed(seed)

# Principal Component Regression
pcr_model_trans <- train(critical_temp ~ .,
             data       = train.data,
             method     = "pcr",
             tuneGrid   = expand.grid(ncomp = seq(2,40,2)),
             trControl  = control,
             preProc = c("center", "scale", "BoxCox"))
summary(pcr_model_trans)
```

```{r}
pcr_model_trans$results
```

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=5,fig.cap="R-Squared, MSE, and MAE for Principal Component Regression Trans"}
plot_metrics(pcr_model_trans, pcr_model_trans$results$ncomp, "Number of Component")
```


```{r}
pcr_model_trans$bestTune
```

From the above results, we can see the corresponding errors to the number of principal components. Here, we will plot and see the optimal number of principal components.


```{r}
getTrainPerf(pcr_model_trans)
```

```{r}
varImp(pcr_model_trans)$importance
```

From the above metrics, the R-Squared for this model is 0.6872938 with Train MSE is 367.4889 However, now the model only has 40 variables as the predictors which is far from the original model.

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variables Importance for Principal Component Regression Trans"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(pcr_model_trans, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```

From above, it can be seen that wtd_std_ThermalConductivity is the most important variable for this model, whereas gmean_fie is the least important variable for this model.

\subsubsection{K-Nearest Neighbor Regression}

K-Nearest Neighbor is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. For regression, the prediction is the average of the response variable of the closest neighbors.

```{r}
set.seed(seed)

# K-Nearest Neighbor Regression
knn_model_trans <- train(critical_temp ~ .,
             method     = "knn",
             tuneGrid   = expand.grid(k = c(1:5)),
             trControl  = control,
             data       = train.data,
             preProc = c("center", "scale","BoxCox"))

knn_model_trans$results
```

From the above results, we can see the corresponding errors to the number of k. Here, we will plot and see the optimal number of k.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=5,fig.cap="R-Squared, MSE, and MAE for KNN Regression Trans"}
plot_metrics(knn_model_trans, knn_model_trans$results$k, "k")
```

```{r}
# Best tuning parameter k that minimize the RMSE
knn_model_trans$bestTune
```

```{r}
getTrainPerf(knn_model_trans)
```

From the result, we know that the best k is 2 with R-Squared 0.905209 and MSE 112.36 So far, this is the best model we have.

Here, we show the variable importance for this model.

```{r}
varImp(knn_model_trans, scale = FALSE)$importance
```

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variables Importance for KNN Regression Trans"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(knn_model_trans, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```


From above, it can be seen that wtd_std_ThermalConductivity is the most important variable for this model, whereas gmean_fie is the least important variable for this model.



\subsubsection{Random Forest}

Random forest provides a strong improvement, which consists of applying bagging to the data and bootstrap sampling to the predictor variables at each split [@bruce2017practical]. This means that at each splitting step of the tree algorithm, a random sample of n predictors is chosen as split candidates from the full set of the predictors.

Here, we will perform a random forest algorithm by using ranger library, there are three main parameter to be tuned which are mtry, splitrule and min.node.size. mtry is number of variables to possibly split at in each node. Default is the (rounded down) square root of the number variables. 

```{r}
set.seed(seed)

# Random Forest
random_forest_model_trans <- train(
  critical_temp ~., data = train.data,
  trControl = trainControl( method = "cv", number = 10, search = "random"),
  tuneLength = 5,
  method = "ranger",
  importance = 'impurity',
  preProc = c("center", "scale", "BoxCox")
)

random_forest_model_trans$results
```

From the above results, we can see the corresponding errors to the number of mtry, splitrule, and minimum node size. Here, we will plot and see the optimal number of those three parameters.


```{r}
random_forest_model_trans$bestTune
```


```{r}
getTrainPerf(random_forest_model_trans)
```

From above, we can see that the optimal model is the model with mtry = 19, splitrule = variance and min.node.size = 13 with R-Squared = 0.9226579 and MSE = 91.01

Here, we show the variable importance for this model.

```{r}
varImp(random_forest_model_trans, scale = FALSE)$importance
```

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variables Importance for Random Forest Trans"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(random_forest_model_trans, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```

From above, it can be seen that range_ThermalConductivity is the most important variable for this model, whereas number_of_elements is the least important variable for this model.


\subsubsection{Gradient Boosting Machine}

Compared to random forests which build an ensemble of deep independent trees, GBMs build an ensemble of shallow and weak successive trees with each tree learning and improving on the previous. When combined, these many weak successive trees produce a powerful combination that are often hard to beat with other algorithms.

For a gradient boosting machine (GBM) model, there are four main tuning parameters, n.trees (number of iterations), interaction.depth (complexity of the tree), shrinkage (learning rate), and m.minobsinnode (the minimum number of trianing set samples in a node to commence splitting).

For the parameters tuning process, we can use apply manual grid search, random grid search or random search tuning. Grid search technique for some cases are more effective, however, it is very time consuming and need much computational cost. Therefore, for this assignment purpose, we will only apply random search tuning with tune length = 2.

```{r}
set.seed(seed)

# Gradient Boosting Machine
gbm_model_trans <- train(critical_temp ~ ., 
                   data = train.data, 
                   method = "gbm", 
                   tuneLength = 4,
                   preProc = c("center", "scale", "BoxCox"),
                   trControl = trainControl( method = "cv", number = 10, search = "random"),
                   verbose = FALSE
                   )

gbm_model_trans$results
```

```{r}
gbm_model_trans$finalModel
```


```{r}
gbm_model_trans$bestTune
```

```{r}
getTrainPerf(gbm_model_trans)
```


From above, we can see that the optimal model is the model with shrinkage = 0.1703574, n.trees = 4304, interaction.depth = 7, and m.minobsinnode = 11. The R-Squared and MSE are 0.9147804 and 100 consecutively.

Here, we show the variable importance for this model.

```{r}
varImp(gbm_model_trans, scale = FALSE)$importance
```

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variables Importance for Gradient Boosting Machine Trans"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(gbm_model_trans, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```


From above, it can be seen that range_ThermalConductivity is the most important variable for this model, whereas number_of_elements is the least important variable for this model which is same to random forest model.


\subsubsection{XG-Boost Regression}

XG-Boost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable. It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework. However, xgboost used a more regularized model formalization to control over-fitting, which gives it better performance.

For this algorithm, the main paratemers for tuning are nrounds, max_depth, eta, gamma, colsample_bytree, min_child_weight, and subsample. eta is the learning rate, gamma specifies the minimum loss reduction required to make a split, colsample_bytree denotes the fraction of columns to be randomly samples for each tree, min_child_weight defines the minimum sum of weights of all observations required in a child and subsample denotes the fraction of observations to be randomly samples for each tree.

For the parameters tuning process, we can use apply manual grid search, random grid search or random search tuning. Grid search technique for some cases are more effective, however, it is very time consuming and need much computational cost. Therefore, for this assignment purpose, we will only apply random search tuning with tune length = 2

```{r}
set.seed(seed)

# XG-Boost Regression
xgb_model_trans <- train(
  critical_temp ~., data = train.data,
  trControl = trainControl( method = "cv", number = 10, search = "random"),
  tuneLength = 4,
  method = "xgbTree",
  verbose = FALSE,
  preProc = c("center", "scale","BoxCox"),
  nthread = 1
)

xgb_model_trans$results
```

```{r}
xgb_model_trans$finalModel
```


```{r}
xgb_model_trans$bestTune
```

```{r}
getTrainPerf(xgb_model_trans)
```


From above, we can see that the optimal model is the model with nrounds = 861, max_depth = 7, eta = 0.1703574, gamma = 2.862233, colsample_bytree = 0.426645, min_child_weight = 4, and subsample = 0.8735088.  The R-Squared and MSE are 0.9184236 and 95.64 consecutively.

Here, we show the variable importance for this model.


```{r}
varImp(xgb_model_trans, scale = FALSE)$importance
```

Next, we will plot the variable importance for this model.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Variables Importance for XG-Boost Trans"}
# Plot the Variable Importance
plot(varImp(xgb_model_trans, scale = FALSE), scales=list(x=list(cex=0.5), y=list(cex=0.5)), 
     xlab=list(cex=0.75), ylab=list(label = "Variables",cex=0.75))
```

From above, it can be seen that wtd_std_ThermalConductivity is the most important variable for this model, whereas std_Valence is the least important variable for this model.


From this section, we have developed in total 28 models. In the next section, we will focus on model comparison and evaluation.




\section{Model Comparison}
\subsection{Model Explanation}

In the previous section, we have performed multiple algorithms to the original dataset and transformed dataset. Based on the similarity, we can categorize those algorithms into regression algorithm, regularization algorithm, dimensionality reduction algorithm, instance-based algorithm and ensemble tree-based algorithm. Before we go into the model comparison, first we will explain about the idea behind them and their strengths and weaknesses.

**Regression Algorithm**

Regression is focus with modeling the linear relationship between variables that is iteratively refined using a loss function by the model. For this category, we performed linear regression and stepwise regression. For the linear regression, we performed three different models for each dataset which are with all variables, exclude the non-significant variables, and exclude the non-correlated variables. Meanwhile, for the stepwise, we performed forward, backward, and hybrid approach. In general, the main strength of this approach is simple, fast and easy to understand and interpret. However, this type of algorithm will perform poorly when the relationship between the predictors and response variable is non-linear. In addition, linear regression is very sensitive to outliers.

**Regularization Algorithm**

In general, a standard linear regression will fail in the case there is high collinearity among the feature variables. Collinearity is the existence of near-linear relationships among the independent variables. This condition will lead the model to have a huge variance which tends to overfit. Regularization technique discourages learning a more complex or flexible model in order to avoid the risk of overfitting by introducing some bias. For this category, we performed ridge, lasso and elastic net regression. Ridge regression shrinks the regression coefficients, so that variables, with minor contribution to the outcome, have their coefficients close to zero. The shrinkage of the coefficients is achieved by penalizing the regression model with a penalty term called L2-norm, which is the sum of the squared coefficients. Lasso shrinks the regression coefficients toward zero by penalizing the regression model with a penalty term called L1-norm, which is the sum of the absolute coefficients. In the case of lasso regression, the penalty has the effect of forcing some of the coefficient estimates, with a minor contribution to the model, to be exactly equal to zero. This means that, lasso can be also seen as an alternative to the subset selection methods for performing variable selection in order to reduce the complexity of the model. Elastic Net produces a regression model that is penalized with both the L1 and L2 regularizations. The consequence of this is to effectively shrink coefficients and to set some coefficients to zero.

**Dimensionality Reduction Algorithm**

Dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the dimension of the features set. For this category, we performed Principal Component Regression (PCR) which popularly used for dimensionality reduction in continuous data. One of the strengths is it can reduce the number of needed features for a model, however, it only works well when the dataset contains highly correlated predictors.

**Instance-based Algorithm**

Instance-based algorithm is a decision problem with instances of training data that are deemed important and required to the model. For this category, we performed K-Nearest Neighbor Regression. In general, some of the strengths of this algorithm is pretty intuitive, simple, no assumptions, and only has 1 parameter which is the number of neighbors. However, one of the key challenges for this model is to determine the optimal number of neighbors.

**Ensemble Tree-based Algorithm**

Tree-based algorithm empower predictive models with high accuracy, stability and ease of interpretation. Unlike linear models, this type of algorithms performs well in non-linear relationships cases. There are some ensemble methods in tree-based algorithm, namely bagging, boosting and stacking. Ensemble methods combine a of predictive models to achieve a better accuracy and model stability.

Bagging is a technique used to reduce the variance of our predictions by combining the result of multiple classifiers modelled on different sub-samples of the same dataset. One of the implementations of bagging models is random forest. This algorithm grows multiple trees in order to predict a new object. The final result is the average of outputs by different trees. One of the benefits from this algorithm is the power of handle large dataset with higher dimensionality. However, it might be over-fit for noisy dataset. 

Boosting is a technique to convert weak learners to strong learners. Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XG-Boost) are two of the boosting implementations.  The advantages of using GBM is often produce accuracy that cannot be beat and no data pre-processing required (often works well with categorical and numerical value). However, this algorithm is very computationally expensive and less interpretable. On the other hand, XGBoost is a specific implementation of the Gradient Boosting method which delivers more accurate approximations by using the strengths of second order derivative of the loss function, L1 and L2 regularization and parallel computing which makes it faster compared to GBM.

```

Table \ref{tab:table1} shows the summary of all models which contains R-Squared, MSE, and MAE. From the table, it can be seen that Random Forest on original data or transformed data outperform other models with Train R-Squared 0.923, whereas the worst model is the model with Principal Component Regression on the tranformed data with Train R-Squared 0.687. We will elaborate more about it at the end of this section.

```{r table1, echo=FALSE}
# Display the Metrics Table
display_table <- data.frame(models.label, R_Square, MSE, MAE)
kable(display_table, caption='Train Metrics Summary for All Models')
```

Now, in order to visualise the matrix in the boxplots, we will resample the cross validation using resamples features from caret. The resamples function can be used to collect, summarize and contrast the resampling results [@Thecaret98:online].

```{r}
set.seed(seed)

# Resample the Cross Validation
results <- resamples(
  list(
    "Linear Regression Model 1" = linear_model1, 
    "Linear Regression Model 2" = linear_model2,
    "Linear regression Model 3" = linear_model3,
    "Linear Regression Backward Selection" = linear_backward,
    "Linear Regression Forward Selection" = linear_forward, 
    "Linear Regression Stepwise Selection" = linear_stepwise,
    "Ridge Regression" = ridge_model,
    "Lasso Regression" = lasso_model, 
    "Elastic Net" = elastic_net_model,
    "Princial Component Regression" = pcr_model, 
    "K-Nearest Neighbor Regression" = knn_model,
    "Random Forest" = random_forest_model,
    "Gradient Boosting Machine" = gbm_model,
    "XG-Boost Regression" = xgb_model, 
    "Linear Regression Model 1 Trans" = linear_model1_trans,

    "Linear regression Model 3 Trans" = linear_model3_trans,

    "Linear Regression Forward Selection Trans" = linear_forward_trans,

    "Gradient Boosting Machine Trans" = gbm_model_trans,
    "XG-Boost Regression Trans" = xgb_model_trans))


# summarize the distributions
results$values
```

From the above result, we can see the information about the R-Squared, MSE and MAE for each fold. Next, we will visualise them using boxplot in order to ease the interpretation.


```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap=paste(c("R-Squared","MSE","MAE"),"Model Comparison")}
# Transpose the Table
train.result <- melt(results$values, id = c("Resample"))[2:3]

train.result <- as.data.frame(
  cbind(do.call('rbind', strsplit(as.character(train.result$variable),'~',fixed=TRUE)), 
        round(train.result$value,3)))

train.result$V4<- ifelse(grepl("Trans", train.result$V1), "Transformed", "Original")
colnames(train.result) <- c("Model","Metrics","Value","Type")

# Boxplot for R-Squared Metric
ggplot(train.result[train.result$Metrics == "Rsquared",], aes(x=Model, 
                                                              y=as.numeric(as.character(Value)), 
                                                              fill = Type)) +
  geom_boxplot() + ylab("Rsquared") + theme_bw() + scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Accent") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

# Boxplot for MSE Metric
ggplot(train.result[train.result$Metrics == "RMSE",], aes(x=Model, 
                                                          y=as.numeric(as.character(Value))^2, 
                                                          fill = Type)) +
  geom_boxplot() + ylab("MSE") + theme_bw() + scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Accent") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

# Boxplot for MAE Metric
ggplot(train.result[train.result$Metrics == "MAE",], aes(x=Model, 
                                                         y=as.numeric(as.character(Value)), 
                                                         fill = Type)) +
  geom_boxplot() + ylab("MAE") + theme_bw() + scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Accent") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```



From the above visualisation, we can easily see and interpret the performance of all models. Here is the results of the model comparison.

* Principal Component Regression is the worst model. This is because PCR will perform well if the dataset contains highly correlated predictors, whereas, in our dataset the majority of the predictors has no correlation to others.
* Ridge, Lasso and Elastic Net Regression perform worse compared to the original linear regression. The is no collinearity among the feature variables in our dataset. As we know that, regularisation will help in the case there is high collinearity among the feature variables, so in this case it does not help to improve the model quality.
* In general, backward, forward, and stepwise selection regression models perform nearly similar with the original linear regression model. This is because all the variables are contributed to the model, therefore, even though we perform the selection, it will not significantly reduce the number of predictors.
* All linear regression related models have almost similar results. In term of R-Squared, all of them have around 0.73. This is because linear regression will perform well only if the solution is linear, whereas, in our dataset, most of the features has no linear relationship to the response variable. This leads us to try non-linear models.
* KNN Regression is one of the top four models. KNN Regression outperforms other linear related models. KNN regression is a nonparametric regression technique that fits regression locally based on the k nearest points to a point under consideration. Therefore, it is suitable for the problem that cannot meet all the assumption in linear regression, because of its flexibility.
* Ensemble tree-based algorithm (GBM, XGBoost and Random Forest) outperform all other models. There are many reason why they perform better among other models. First, our dataset has high dimension. As we know that ensemble tree-based algorithms perform well in handling large dataset with higher dimensionality. Second, most of the variables in our dataset have non linear relationship with the response variable. However, the weakness of these models is having more parameter to be tuned which leads to time complexity.
* In general, data transformation does not increase the performance of the model. For non-linear models, data transformation basically is not needed, because those models do not need the linear assumption, whereas for linear related models, the models with transformed data are worse, this might because some information are loss during the transformation process. 


\subsection{Prediction}
In this subsection, we will predict the test data and calculate the MSE for each model.

```{r}
pred.data <- as.data.frame(test.data$critical_temp)

mse.data <- data.frame(Model = character(),
                       MSE = numeric(),
                 stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

# Store the Prediction and Test MSE
for(i in seq(1, length(models))){
  prediction <- predict(models[i],
                       newdata = test.data[,-82])
  pred.data[,models.label[i]] <- prediction
  mse.data[nrow(mse.data) + 1,] = c(models.label[i],round(mse(as.vector(prediction[[1]]), 
                                                        test.data$critical_temp),3))
}
```

Table \ref{tab:table2} shows Test Mean Square Error (MSE). It can be seen that the test error follows the pattern of the train metrics. Random Forest has the lowest MSE 81.317, whereas PCA has the largest test MSE. For details can be seen in the table. 

```{r table2, echo=FALSE}
kable(mse.data, caption='Test Metrics Summary for All Models')
```

Next, we will visualise the test MSE for better representation.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap="Model with MSE Test Data"}
mse.data$MSE <- as.numeric(as.character(mse.data$MSE))

# Horizontal Barplot for MSE
ggplot(mse.data) +
  geom_bar(aes(y=MSE, x=reorder(Model, -MSE), fill = -MSE), 
           stat="identity", position="dodge" )+ xlab("Model") +
  coord_flip() + theme_bw() + labs(fill = "MSE")
```


Next we will visualise the sequence of real critical temperature compared to predicted critical temperature from each model. As shown below, for the better model, the blue line covers almost all the red lines.

```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=5,fig.cap=paste("Sequence of Prediction vs Real Values with ",models.label)}
# Visualise the Sequence of Prediction and Real Values
for(label in models.label){
sequence_data = seq(1:length(test.data$critical_temp))
plot(sequence_data, test.data$critical_temp, type="l", col="red", 
     ylab = "Critical Temperature", xlab = "Sequence of Test Data")
lines(sequence_data, pred.data[,label], col="blue", xlab="", ylab="")
legend("topleft", legend=c("critical_temp_original", "critical_temp_predicted"),
        col=c("red", "blue"), lty=1,cex=0.8)
  cat('\n\n')
}

```

Next, we will visualise scatter plot of the real critical temperature compared to the predicted critical temperature. As shown below, the better model has a more linear relationship between the real critical temperature and the predicted value.


```{r fig.width=7,fig.height=5,fig.cap=paste("Scatter Plot of Prediction vs Real Values with ",models.label)}
# Visualise the Scatter Plot of Prediction vs Real Value
for(label in models.label){
plot(test.data$critical_temp, pred.data[,label], col="red", ylab = paste0("Prediction with ", label), 
     xlab = "Real Value")
grid()
abline(0, 1, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
  cat('\n\n')
}

```


We have done the model evaluation, in the next section we will identify the important variable for predicting the critical temperature. 


\section{Variable Identification and Explanation}
In this section, we will describe about the variable importance. At the section above, we have show and visualise the variable importance for each model. Here, we will analysis these variables in general. In order to do that, we will store of the variable importance information from each model, then we will do the high level analysis on the data.

```{r figam, fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap=paste("Variables Importance for All Models")}

var.data <- as.data.frame(colnames(train.data[,-82]))
colnames(var.data)  <- c("Variables")

i <- 1

# Store the Variables Importance
for(model in models){
  temp <- as.data.frame(varImp(model)$importance)
  temp <- cbind(newColName = rownames(temp), temp)
  rownames(temp) <- 1:nrow(temp)
  temp$Overall <- round(scales::rescale(temp$Overall, to = c(1,100)))
  colnames(temp) <- c("Variables",models.label[i])
  var.data <- merge(x = var.data, y = temp, by = "Variables", all.x = TRUE)
  i <- i + 1
}
var.data[is.na(var.data)] <- 0
var.data$total <- rowSums(var.data[-1])

var.data.m <- melt(var.data[-30], id = c("Variables"))
var.data.m$Variables <- factor(var.data.m$Variables, levels = unique(colnames(train.data[,-82])))

# Visualise the Variable Importance from All Models
ggplot(var.data.m, aes(x = Variables, y = value, label = value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip() + theme_bw()
```


Figure \@ref(fig:figam) shows the variable importance from all models in general. However, different type of models might treat the variable importance differently. Therefore, we will split the variable importance data into 3 parts which are linear models, instance-based models, and ensemble tree-based models as follows.


```{r figlm, fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap=paste("Variables Importance for Linear Models")}
# Visualise the Variable Importance from Linear Models
ggplot(var.data.m[var.data.m$variable %in% linear.models,], 
       aes(x = Variables, y = value, label = value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip() + theme_bw()
```

Figure \@ref(fig:figlm) shows the variable importance from linear related models. If we choose 25 as the threshold, then mean_atomic_mass, gmean_atomic_mass, mean_fie, gmean_fie, std_Density, mean_ElectronAffinity, range_FusionHeat, std_FusionHeat, wtd_entropy_ThermalConductivity, range_Valence, and std_Valence are the less important variables. This is inline with our finding from the correlation matrix, all of these variables have no correlation to the response variable. Meanwhile, the top 5 most important variables are wtd_entropy_Valence, wtd_gmean_Valence, mean_Valence, wtd_std_ThermalConductivity and std_ThermalConductivity. Therefore, we can conclude that Valence and ThermalConductivity are the two main properties for predicting the critical temperature. 

```{r figibm, fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap=paste("Variables Importance for Instance-Based Models")}
# Visualise the Variable Importance from Instance-Based Models
ggplot(var.data.m[var.data.m$variable %in% instance.models,], 
       aes(x = Variables, y = value, label = value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip() + theme_bw()
```

Figure \@ref(fig:figibm) shows the variable importance from instance-based models. If we choose 25 as the threshold, then mean_atomic_mass, gmean_atomic_mass, mean_fie, gmean_fie, mean_atomic_radius, gmean_atomic_radius, range_Density, std_Density, mean_ElectronAffinity, wtd_gmean_ElectronAffinity, range_ElectronAffinity, std_ElectronAffinity, range_FusionHeat, std_FusionHeat, entropy_ThermalConductivity, wtd_entropy_ThermalConductivity, range_Valence, and std_Valance are the less important variables. Meanwhile, the top 5 most important variables are wtd_mean_Valence, wtd_gmean_Valence, wtd_std_ThermalConductivity, wtd_entropy_atomic_mass, and range_ThermalConductivity. Therefore, we can also conclude that Valence and ThermalConductivity are the two main properties for predicting the critical temperature. 


```{r figetbm, fig.width=7,fig.height=8,fig.cap=paste("Variables Importance for Ensemble Tree-Based Models")}
# Visualise the Variable Importance from Ensemble Tree-Based Models
ggplot(var.data.m[var.data.m$variable %in% treebased.models,], 
       aes(x = Variables, y = value, label = value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip() + theme_bw()
```

Figure \@ref(fig:figetbm) shows the variable importance from instance-based models. If we choose 12.5 as the threshold, then range_atomic_radius, wtd_range_ElectronAffinity, wtd_gmean_ThermalConductivity range_ThermalConductivity, std_ThermalConductivity, wtd_std_ThermalConductivity, wtd_gmean_Valence, wtd_entropy_Valence are the most important variables. Therefore, we can also conclude that Valence and ThermalConductivity are the two main properties for predicting the critical temperature. 

From the above analysis, we can conclude that in predicting critical temperature of superconductor, Valence and ThermalConductivity are the most important properties. 

\section{Conclusion}
The purpose of this assessment is to predict the critical temperature of superconductor materials. In order to achieve this target, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed on the dataset to gain the insights and correlations between the variables. Data transformation was one of the main finding during the EDA because most of variables have skewed distribution. In addition, from EDA, we know that most of the variables have no correlation to the response variable. In the model development step, 14 algorithms were applied to original dataset and dataset with BoxCox transformation (28 models in total). Those algorithms consist of regression, regularization, dimensional reduction and ensemble tree-based algorithms.

Meanwhile, in the model evaluation step, the performance of each algorithm was evaluated. The results show that Instance-based and ensemble tree-based algorithm outperformed other linear regression algorithms with R-Squared 0.923 (Random Forest),  0.914 (Gradient Boosting Machine) and 0.918 (XGBoost). This is inline with the early finding that the relation between predictors and response variable is non-linear. Regularization and dimensionality reduction algorithms performed worse compared to original linear regression because there is no significant correlation between predictors.

Finally, in general Valence and ThermalConductivity are the two most important properties in predicting critical temperature of superconductor materials.

\section{Future Work}
To go further with this dataset, one of the promising future works is by applying ensemble learning on top of the models. Ensemble learning is a process by which multiple models are strategically generated and combined to solve particular computational intelligence problem. Besides that, stacking learning might also can enhance the performance of the single algorithm.

Furthermore, in order to increase the accuracy of the model, improving the hyperparameter tuning step will be a choice to go. However, computational cost and time complexity are two main issues that need to be considered for this option.
